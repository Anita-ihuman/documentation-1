# Core Contributors Guidelines

## Design

Hey, there! 👋🏽

We welcome all kinds of contributions, please feel free to contribute and/or ask questions.
Someone will attend to your issue soon ☺️

Unsure of where to begin contributing to OSCA as a **designer**? 

You can start by looking through the `good first issues` label. Also, you might want to contribute to a particular aspect of design that you’re most proficient in … don’t worry we’ve got you! Each design task is given a label of the type of design work required to complete that issue `UI/UX`, `graphics`, `design-documentation`.


Yes! 💪🏽 seen what you’d love to help with?

Just start, you don’t need approval from anyone. Be sure that when you start, change issue label to `design-in progress`. Once you have something ready for review use the `design-ready` label, someone will attend to you ☺️.  

We can’t wait to receive your contributions! :)
