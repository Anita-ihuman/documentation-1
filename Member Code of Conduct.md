# **MEMBER CODE OF CONDUCT**

###### _“Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much”_

Open Source Community Africa(OSCA) is a diverse community which supports developers, designers, writers and all other spheres of technology. In order for a peaceful co-existence here is the members code of conduct.

### GENERAL

* Be respectful: A popular saying goes, treat others how you want to be treated. All members of OSCA are expected to be of most polite manner when interacting with other members. It’s team effort and we may not always agree, disagreement is not room for insult.
* Be considerate: All opinions matter, in some cases you would find yourself compromising and that is the team spirit. You are not a team because you work together, you are team because you trust, respect and care for each other.
* Be Patient: You would be working with a lot of people who are unique in their own way, patience is a virtue that would go a long way for comfort.
* Licensing: When writing codes, if you need to copy a code please read its license. When writing an article for the OSCA newsletter or medium page, do not advertise proprietary softwares or any product that is not open sourced.
* Be Collaborative: "The best teamwork comes from men who are working independently toward one goal in unison." – James Cash Penney. You are not generally expected to complete tasks alone, reach out and get other team members involved.
* Sexual jokes or harassment due to race, religion or gender is not welcome at OSCA. At meetups or events make sure you have consent before having physical contact with anyone that may be deemed inappropriate. We hope to keep our environs safe.
* At OSCA meetups there would be no weapons allowed, no smoking on the premises as well.
